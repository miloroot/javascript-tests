# javascript-tests
Repo to test out different javascript things that comes to mind.
Each test will be inside a folder with name "test_#", where # is the number of the test.

## Added tests.
### /test_one
Change what a function does, depending if a variable is true or false.

### /test_two
Override a function depending on a variables true or false state.
Test failed as functions cant be read inside if-statements, or at least so it seems.
And its probably also bad practice.
Better to do a function that takes parameters and execute inside if-statement
with correct parameters. (already knew this, but look at the repos name)

### /test_three
Trying out some ES6 code/syntax, see if Chrome 46 can handle it out of the box,
with no transpiler/compiler.
